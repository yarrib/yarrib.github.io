    "text": "Today I encountered an interesting challenge while working in Azure Machine Learning at work. First I’ll provide a little overview of Azure ML as a tool, and explain where git-lfs comes into play.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy challenge today was doing some professional development, building a sample model and deploying a Gradio to HuggingFace Spaces (HF). Well as it turns out the model.pkl file that I created in training my simple model doesn’t play nicely with HF.\n\n\nSimply put, large files and large binary files like .pkl files are both too large and not the intended type of file to be saved into typical distributed version control like git. Thankfully, the brilliant folks who build and maintain git stuff created git-lfs, a.k.a. Git Large File Storage. This allows the references to the big files to be pushed into a repo while separating the big files themselves into some other place. I’m not going to go into the details of how it works because (1) I only have a topical knowledge, and (2) that isn’t the point.\nLets see how to enable it in AzureML:\n\nStart a compute in AzureML\nOpen a terminal\ninstall git lfs from source using sudo apt-get (if apt/debian, else yum)\ninstantiate any repos that will use lfs\nadd and commit files as usual\nobserve how lfs files are pushed"

    "text": "Why would I blog?\n\nPlus some bonus Python coding\n\n\nPhoto by Ameen Fahmy on Unsplash\nThe main reason I’m starting this blog is because I’ve been hesitant to do so. I prefer not to share too much information, so this is a sort of personal challenge. Also, Jeremy and Rachel over at FastAI are adament about blogging as a means of learning deep learning (or any topic for that matter). I agree with this perspective despite maintaining that the idea of blogging is better than actually doing it. I’ll keep tabs on this perspective over time.\nI’m going to do things a little differently, in my own style, and will probably break a bunch of blogging guidelines. I’m going to be mixing thoughts and ideas with data science code snippets and projects. While I have some ideas for upcoming posts I also am likely to interject random tutorials which I would consider things that are useful to me.\nThe goal of this isn’t to make money or anything like that. It is simply to get comfortable being uncomfortable in posting content and sharing thoughts, ideas and projects. The personal gain I am seeking will be the product of committing to the habit and practicing it.\nSo with that, lets go through a little python code that I find to be indespensible: comprehensions. I find myself interjecting list and dictionary comprehensions in all manner of code I write in Python. For instance, if I need to: filter some data based on a condition, manipulate dictionary keys and values, or update Pandas Dataframe column names. I’ll show those examples below, in contrast with some other methods.\n\n\nComprehensions\nPerform calculations on a list\nFirst we need a list to work with, which is easy enough to create in python:\n\nlist_1 = list(range(25))\nprint(list_1)\n\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n\n\nOk, so we have a list. Lets find the odd numbers using loops:\n\nodd_nums = []\nfor item in list_1:\n    if item%2 != 0:\n        odd_nums.append(item)\nprint(odd_nums)\n\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23]\n\n\nWell that works, but kind of long winded. A list comp can shorten it up for us:\n\nodd_nums_lc = [item for item in list_1 if item%2 != 0]\nprint(odd_nums_lc)\n\n[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23]\n\n\nSimilar methods also work for nested lists. It should be noted however, that comprehensions can be harder to read, so extensively nested statements might be best being split up or incorporating some sort of loop or helper function.\nGetting some corpus - body of text - into a dictionary of word counts\nWell we need a dict, so lets take some text and do a word count. We will use the first 2 paragraphs from the Wikipedia entry for Gandalf\n\ngandalf = \"\"\"\nGandalf is a protagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien's novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. \nHe is a wizard, one of the Istari order, and the leader of the Fellowship of the Ring. Tolkien took the \nname \"Gandalf\" from the Old Norse \"Catalogue of Dwarves\" (Dvergatal) in the Völuspá.\n\nAs a wizard and the bearer of one of the Three Rings, Gandalf has great power, but works mostly by \nencouraging and persuading. He sets out as Gandalf the Grey, possessing great knowledge and \ntravelling continually. Gandalf is focused on the mission to counter the Dark Lord Sauron by \ndestroying the One Ring. He is associated with fire; his ring of power is Narya, the Ring of \nFire. As such, he delights in fireworks to entertain the hobbits of the Shire, while in great \nneed he uses fire as a weapon. As one of the Maiar, he is an immortal spirit from Valinor, \nbut his physical body can be killed.\n\"\"\"\n\ngandalf\n\n'\\nGandalf is a protagonist in J. R. R.

So lets do that. we need to strip special characters, quotes, and some other things.\nSteps: - use a regular expression (regex) to strip out punctuaton - convert everything to lower\n\nimport re\n\ngandalf_filtered = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]|\\n', '', gandalf).lower().split(' ')\nprint(gandalf_filtered)\n\n['gandalf', 'is', 'a', 'protagonist', 'in', 'j', 'r', 'r', 'tolkiens', 'novels', 'the', 'hobbit', 'and', 'the', 'lord', 'of', 'the', 'rings', 'he', 'is', 'a', 'wizard', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'istari', 'order', 'and', 'the', 'leader', 'of', 'the', 'fellowship', 'of', 'the', 'ring', 'tolkien', 'took', 'the', 'name', 'gandalf', 'from', 'the', 'old', 'norse', 'catalogue', 'of', 'dwarves', 'dvergatal', 'in', 'the', 'völuspáas', 'a', 'wizard', 'and', 'the', 'bearer', 'of', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'three', 'rings', 'gandalf', 'has', 'great', 'power', 'but', 'works', 'mostly', 'by', 'encouraging', 'and', 'persuading', 'he', 'sets', 'out', 'as', 'gandalf', 'the', 'grey', 'possessing', 'great', 'knowledge', 'and', 'travelling', 'continually', 'gandalf', 'is', 'focused', 'on', 'the', 'mission', 'to', 'counter', 'the', 'dark', 'lord', 'sauron', 'by', 'destroying', 'the', 'one', 'ring', 'he', 'is', 'associated', 'with', 'fire', 'his', 'ring', 'of', 'power', 'is', 'narya', 'the', 'ring', 'of', 'fire', 'as', 'such', 'he', 'delights', 'in', 'fireworks', 'to', 'entertain', 'the', 'hobbits', 'of', 'the', 'shire', 'while', 'in', 'great', 'need', 'he', 'uses', 'fire', 'as', 'a', 'weapon', 'as', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'maiar', 'he', 'is', 'an', 'immortal', 'spirit', 'from', 'valinor', 'but', 'his', 'physical', 'body', 'can', 'be', 'killed']\n\n\nOk, so we have this list of words. Now what? Well to get the word counts we have a few options: - Cheat and use collections.Counter - Use a for loop\nIn either case we can get our word counts into a dict, but using a dictionary comprehension isn’t super efficient because we need to do some information retrieval from the dict. An alternative is using collections.defaultdict.\n\n# method 1: collections.Counter\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ngandalf_wc_v1 = Counter(gandalf_filtered)\nprint(gandalf_wc_v1)\n\nCounter({'the': 20, 'of': 11, 'is': 6, 'he': 6, 'gandalf': 5, 'and': 5, 'a': 4, 'in': 4, 'one': 4, 'ring': 4, 'as': 4, 'great': 3, 'fire': 3, 'r': 2, 'lord': 2, 'rings': 2, 'wizard': 2, 'from': 2, 'power': 2, 'but': 2, 'by': 2, 'to': 2, 'his': 2, 'protagonist': 1, 'j': 1, 'tolkiens': 1, 'novels': 1, 'hobbit': 1, 'istari': 1, 'order': 1, 'leader': 1, 'fellowship': 1, 'tolkien': 1, 'took': 1, 'name': 1, 'old': 1, 'norse': 1, 'catalogue': 1, 'dwarves': 1, 'dvergatal': 1, 'völuspáas': 1, 'bearer': 1, 'three': 1, 'has': 1, 'works': 1, 'mostly': 1, 'encouraging': 1, 'persuading': 1, 'sets': 1, 'out': 1, 'grey': 1, 'possessing': 1, 'knowledge': 1, 'travelling': 1, 'continually': 1, 'focused': 1, 'on': 1, 'mission': 1, 'counter': 1, 'dark': 1, 'sauron': 1, 'destroying': 1, 'associated': 1, 'with': 1, 'narya': 1, 'such': 1, 'delights': 1, 'fireworks': 1, 'entertain': 1, 'hobbits': 1, 'shire': 1, 'while': 1, 'need': 1, 'uses': 1, 'weapon': 1, 'maiar': 1, 'an': 1, 'immortal': 1, 'spirit': 1, 'valinor': 1, 'physical': 1, 'body': 1, 'can': 1, 'be': 1, 'killed': 1})\n\n\n\n# method 2: for loop\n\ngandalf_wc_v2 = {}\n# Count number of times each word comes up in list of words (in dictionary)\nfor w in gandalf_filtered:\n    if w not in gandalf_wc_v2.keys():\n        gandalf_wc_v2[w] = 1\n    else:\n        gandalf_wc_v2[w] += 1\n\nprint(gandalf_wc_v2)\n\n{'gandalf': 5, 'is': 6, 'a': 4, 'protagonist': 1, 'in': 4, 'j': 1, 'r': 2, 'tolkiens': 1, 'novels': 1, 'the': 20, 'hobbit': 1, 'and': 5, 'lord': 2, 'of': 11, 'rings': 2, 'he': 6, 'wizard': 2, 'one': 4, 'istari': 1, 'order': 1, 'leader': 1, 'fellowship': 1, 'ring': 4, 'tolkien': 1, 'took': 1, 'name': 1, 'from': 2, 'old': 1, 'norse': 1, 'catalogue': 1, 'dwarves': 1, 'dvergatal': 1, 'völuspáas': 1, 'bearer': 1, 'three': 1, 'has': 1, 'great': 3, 'power': 2, 'but': 2, 'works': 1, 'mostly': 1, 'by': 2, 'encouraging': 1, 'persuading': 1, 'sets': 1, 'out': 1, 'as': 4, 'grey': 1, 'possessing': 1, 'knowledge': 1, 'travelling': 1, 'continually': 1, 'focused': 1, 'on': 1, 'mission': 1, 'to': 2, 'counter': 1, 'dark': 1, 'sauron': 1, 'destroying': 1, 'associated': 1, 'with': 1, 'fire': 3, 'his': 2, 'narya': 1, 'such': 1, 'delights': 1, 'fireworks': 1, 'entertain': 1, 'hobbits': 1, 'shire': 1, 'while': 1, 'need': 1, 'uses': 1, 'weapon': 1, 'maiar': 1, 'an': 1, 'immortal': 1, 'spirit': 1, 'valinor': 1, 'physical': 1, 'body': 1, 'can': 1, 'be': 1, 'killed': 1}\n\n\nI will use either method, but tend to prefer writing less code that I have to maintain. If there is a helper class or function that is in a stable release of a library, it makes life easier to use it.\nBecause it doesn’t matter much which one we use for our example, we’ll just grab gandalf_wc_v2 and get the top N values that exceed a certain word length. There are a ton of ways to do this, we will just use plain python.\n\nWe could have done this in one more line on our collections.Counter method call like this: gandalf_wc_v1.most_common(n=5)\n\nBut that is too easy, so let’s do it longhand:\n\n# key value pairs where key is >= 3\ngandalf_wl_geq_3 = {k:v for k,v in gandalf_wc_v2.items() if len(k) >= 3}\n# top N counts\nn = 5\ntop_n = sorted(gandalf_wl_geq_3.values(), reverse=True)[:n]\n#[20, 5, 5, 4, 4]\n\n# finally, a fun use of a dict comp:\n{k:v for k,v in gandalf_wl_geq_3.items() if v in top_n}\n\n{'gandalf': 5, 'the': 20, 'and': 5, 'one': 4, 'ring': 4}\n\n\nLast but perhaps one of the best, comprehensions on Pandas Dataframe columns\nlets create a dataframe with some sample data. To make it interesting I’ll use some comprehensions and other native python capabilities to create a dataset for this example, instead of using Iris or Housing.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nyrs = range(2018,2022,1)\ncities = 'Bozeman, MT', 'Spokane, WA', 'Bangor, ME', 'White Plains, NY', 'Sedona, AZ'\ncat1 = ['wizard', 'ranger', 'elf', 'hutt', 'orc', 'nazgul', 'numenorean', 'deciever']\n\ncolnames = 'year','city','role','points'\nds = [[y,c,k, np.random.randint(-10, 10)] for k in cat1 for c in cities for y in yrs]\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(ds, columns=colnames)\ndisplay(df.head(3), df.shape)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      year\n      city\n      role\n      points\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      2018\n      Bozeman, MT\n      wizard\n      3\n    \n    \n      1\n      2019\n      Bozeman, MT\n      wizard\n      -9\n    \n    \n      2\n      2020\n      Bozeman, MT\n      wizard\n      -8\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n(160, 4)\n\n\nSo we have some meaningless data. Now lets group by to get a multiindex that we want to manipulate, the whole point of this little exercise.\n\ndfg = df.groupby(by=['city', 'role']).agg({'points': ['mean','sum', np.std]}).reset_index()\ndfg.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      city\n      role\n      points\n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      mean\n      sum\n      std\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Bangor, ME\n      deciever\n      4.50\n      18\n      3.872983\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bangor, ME\n      elf\n      0.75\n      3\n      7.889867\n    \n    \n      2\n      Bangor, ME\n      hutt\n      -1.25\n      -5\n      5.560276\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSo this isn’t super useful for anything. Now normally some dataset for machine learning or what not will have a much broader set of columns (a.k.a. features), but the concept is pretty much the same. Just remember to work on manageable chunks and don’t get intimidated by a long chain of transformations.\n\nprint(f'Initial column list: {dfg.columns}')\n\nInitial column list: MultiIndex([(  'city',     ''),\n            (  'role',     ''),\n            ('points', 'mean'),\n            ('points',  'sum'),\n            ('points',  'std')],\n           )\n\n\nSo first I’ll demonstrate updating this with a list comprehension. This is a bit more complex of a list comprehension in that in incorporates a conditional ''.join in the output. Basically what is happening is we are looking at each tuple in the multiindex, and if the last item is an empty string, we underscore join all but the lst element, otherwise we join the whole thing.\n\ndfg_copy1 = dfg.copy()\ndfg_copy1.columns = ['_'.join(list(x) if len(x[-1]) > 0 else x[:-1]) for x in dfg_copy1.columns]\ndfg_copy1.head(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      city\n      role\n      points_mean\n      points_sum\n      points_std\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Bangor, ME\n      deciever\n      4.50\n      18\n      3.872983\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bangor, ME\n      elf\n      0.75\n      3\n      7.889867\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nThere is another way, however, that is pretty clever. It is more of a functional style and I’m fairly certain I’ve seen it used in the Fast AI course or notebooks in addition to numerous tutorials on the internet. We will be using the map function over our columns.\n\ndfg_copy2 = dfg.copy()\ndfg_copy2.columns = dfg_copy2.columns.map(lambda x : '_'.join(x) if x[-1] == '_' else x[0])\n\ndfg_copy2.head(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      city\n      role\n      points\n      points\n      points\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      Bangor, ME\n      deciever\n      4.50\n      18\n      3.872983\n    \n    \n      1\n      Bangor, ME\n      elf\n      0.75\n      3\n      7.889867\n    \n    \n      2\n      Bangor, ME\n      hutt\n      -1.25\n      -5\n      5.560276\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nWhile this is really quick and easy if there isn’t any weird conditions (e.g. you can just use {dataframe_name}.columns.map('_'.join)), above we only have the multiindex on some columns, so handling the city and role columns differently is something useful to do for readbility. So there you have it, a bonus method of map + lambda to achieve the same goal as a list comprehension.\n\nWell for now that is plenty of information. Hopefully this helps a future task of yours regardless of your proficiency in technical terminonology."

For example, given some data and some label that it belongs to, e.g. demographic data (features) that maps to what your income might be (target), we try to create a model which “learns” how X (features) maps to y (target).\nA model architecture is the math behind this process. Neural nets are flexible because they learn latent relationships by doing a bunch of linear algebra and calculus in the background, in an authomated, iterative fashion.\nShort version:\n\nWe use a model architecture, pass information into it, and get predictions on this data. This fitting process is something we iterate over until we have a satisfactory result that allows us to make some predictions or inferences about a subset of the world. There are lots of domains and ways to do this, and a rapidly expanding domain of study under the Data Science umbrella.\n\nDo you need to know the details beyond this? Eventually, but it isn’t critical to accomplish some tasks. Worry about it later!\n\nCan deep learning be easy?\n\nJeremy Howard says it can be learned by doing, and some things that were beyond difficult a decade ago are trivial today.\nIt is not easy, however, nor is it quick to learn. Add a little bit of info on a regular basis and you will accumilate knowledge.\nPractice makes permanent.\n\nWhat is a simple way to train a model?\n\nOpen source product plug: Fastai is great for deep learning.\nLets train a model thats slightly more exciting than the two-class classifier in Lesson 1 and 2 of the Fast.ai course.\nSteps:\n\nget data\npreprocess data\ntrain model\nevaulate result\npublish model to Huggingface Spaces\n\n\n\n#imports\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\n# get data\n\n\n# setup dataloaders\n\n\n# train model\n\n\n# save model\n\n\n# get predictions"
